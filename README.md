# Youtube plays
A newbie programmer's experience with making a chat reading bot for youtube

This is my attempt at making a bot that reads the Youtube chat and converts commands into outputs via vjoy.
I wrote this using Python.

I used these Twitch plays examples of code for reference:

I also looked at Pimanrules's code for YouTube Plays Super Mario Odyssey for reference too,
mosty for the system that allows commands to be queued:

I use the pytchat module to find and read the Youtube livechat, it seems to work well.
I should probably look at the Youtube API for Python at some point but this is more easy.
